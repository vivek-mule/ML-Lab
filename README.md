    - Performing indexing, sorting, and data type conversions  
  - **Dataset:** *Customers.csv*  

- **Practical 2 –**
  - **Key Tasks:**  
    - Computing summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles, etc.)  
    - Creating histograms and other visualizations to detect patterns and outliers  
    - Cleaning, integrating, and transforming data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features)  
    - Building a machine learning classification model using algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or SVM  
    - Evaluating the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall
